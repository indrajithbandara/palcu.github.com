Day 3<br />I woke up with my stomach hurting a little because I was hungry. I usually procrastinate in the bed half an hour before I wake up. But, this time I knew I could prepare a meal in a minute. After taking 5-6 sips of Joylent, my stomach stopped complaining.<br /><br />Everytime I drink that stuff, I feel like I see myself zoomed out with an energy bar that is raising. It feels so alien, but at the same time it feels so natural to nourish in that way.
