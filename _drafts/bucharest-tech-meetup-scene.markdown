After 3 years in Bucharest, I'll be moving out of it to London. However, I cannot do that without giving my congratiulations to all the tech communities that make the capital of Romania a nice place to learn new and interesting stuff.

## Generalist gatherings

If you open the [meetup.com][0] Bucharest tech page, the first one will be [The Agile Software Group][1]. And for a good reason. It started in 2008, 8 years ago and it has some of the best speakers and topics. Besides the main Agile Talks meetings, there are the Code and Beer ones, where people enjoy to brag, troll and do other programming specific peculiar things.

The [Softbinator meetups][2], are a bi-weekly gathering that have been held for over 80 times. The group who is organizing it is tight knit, and the [perseverence][3] of them have is astonishing. The people come regularly and if you will feel like most of them will be your friends after a beer or two. Except the trolls... don't feed them. Also, their [Facebook group][4] has some quality posts and discussions.

## Specific ones

The [Bucharest Java][5] [User Group][6] is one of the oldest meetups around. I've been only to two of them, due to the fact that Java has not been one of my primary interests.

The [Bucharest Big Data meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Bucharest-Big-Data-Meetup/) has some pretty hard core presentations. When I was at Hootsuite, we even recruited a senior engineer from that meetup.

I haven't been able to go to the [Bucharest Functional Programming](http://www.meetup.com/bucharestfp/) meetups, due to the fact that the places are limited to a max of ~20 people and they always fill them quickly. However, I think Ionut G. Stan surely knows what's he doing and their [website](http://bucharestfp.ro) has some really hard core titles.

[http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-bucharest/](Papers We Love) is a massive success internationally, and in Bucharest it has been hosted for half an year. I was only at the first one and there seem to be a lot of people from IBM. We had some pretty interesting discussions about the Map/Reduce paper and shared lots of stories about our experience with it.

For web development there is the [http://www.meetup.com/BucharestJS/](BucharestJS) meetup where you learn about the hipster libraries in town. There is also a [React meetup](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1633618413528676/) organized by Hootsuite, where you'll learn about the bleeding-edge hipster libraries in town.


After uberVU was acquired by Hootsuite, Vladimir had more free time so he decided to start a [product meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Bucharest/).
