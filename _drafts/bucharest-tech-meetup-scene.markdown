After 3 years in Bucharest, I'll be moving out of it to London. However, I cannot do that without giving my congratiulations to all the tech communities that make the capital of Romania a nice place to learn new and interesting stuff.

## Generalist gatherings

If you open the [meetup.com][0] Bucharest tech page, the first one will be [The Agile Software Group][1]. And for a good reason. It started in 2008, 8 years ago and it has some of the best speakers and topics. Besides the main Agile Talks meetings, there are the Code and Beer ones, where people enjoy to brag, troll and do other programming specific peculiar things.

The [Softbinator meetups][2], are a bi-weekly gathering that have been held for over 80 times. The group who is organizing it is tight knit, and the [perseverence][3] of them have is astonishing. The people come regularly and if you will feel like most of them will be your friends after a beer or two. Except the trolls... don't feed them. Also, their [Facebook group][4] has some quality posts and discussions.

## Specific ones

The [Bucharest Java][5] [User Group][6] is one of the oldest meetups around. I've been only to two of them, due to the fact that Java has not been one of my primary interests.
