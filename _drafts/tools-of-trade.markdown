When I was young, I was reading the Romanian version of [digerati](http://digerati.ro) and learning about different tools people were using to be productive.

## Hardware

I own a 13" Macbook Air with SSD from 2012 that I wouldn't trade for anything else. Except for another Air with Retina. At the office I have a 15" Macbook Pro that I sometimes think is too heavy. My mobile phone is a Google Nexus 5. I lost my first Nexus in a taxi and just bought another one after I got lost in the city without a GPS. I read books every evening from my trusty Kindle Paperwhite. Finally, I don't live my house without my external Anker battery fully charged, and without my iPod full of audiobooks or good music.

## Communications

I start my morning opening GMail where I have 5 other email accounts connected, read all the morning newsletters, reply or archive till I get to inbox zero. I always have the messenger.com tab pinned in my top left corner of my browser, but I do not allow notifications to appear.
