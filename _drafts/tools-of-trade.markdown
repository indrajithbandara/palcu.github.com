When I was young, I was reading the Romanian version of [digerati](http://digerati.ro) and learning about different tools people were using to be productive. I think now I've used lots of them so I can share what works for me better.

## Hardware

I own a 13" Macbook Air with SSD from 2012 that I wouldn't trade for anything else. Except for another Air with Retina. At the office I have a 15" Macbook Pro that I sometimes think is too heavy. My mobile phone is a Google Nexus 5. I lost my first Nexus in a taxi and just bought another one after I got lost in the city without any kind of map app. I read books every evening from my trusty Kindle Paperwhite. Finally, I don't live my house without my external Anker battery fully charged, my iPod full of audiobooks and my Earpods. My backups go to an external My Book hard disk. I scribble down notes on my Moleskine notebook when I read books.

## Communicating

I start my morning opening GMail where I have 5 other email accounts connected, read all the morning newsletters, reply or archive till I get to inbox zero. I always have the messenger.com tab pinned in my top left corner of my browser, but I do not allow notifications to appear. Slack is always open because everybody at work uses it, WhatsApp is where groups of people talk and Signal is the place where I share secrets with my friends.

## Working

I spend most of my time in Google Chrome because of the dev tools and in Sublime Text 3 because of the ease of search and navigation in a codebase. I have an iTerm 2 console open with ZSH and my dotfiles. I go back and forth between the git command line and the Github app for diffs. I've recently discovered Paw for requests I was doing with `curl`. If I have to edit under 5 files, I'll still go to my trusty Vim editor. I keep a box on Digitalocean with palcu.ro and other personal web apps.

## Getting Shit Done

For home, I have been trusting Remember The Milk for over 4 years now to keep my tasks. My native calendar apps on my devices get their information from Google Calendar. I religiously use Pomodoro Done to split and measure my time units of work. Evernote is a knowledge base of whatever I may want to know, from tips for writing bash scripts to how to make spaghetti. I also love the Evernote Web Clipper, which I was to dump +10 articles a day. My morning and evening rituals are started using the Fabulous App. Habitica makes me keep track of my habits, like writing on my blog or washing the dishes in a fun and competitive manner. I keep my grocery list into Google Keep. The ultimate killer app is Pocket, because I can throw articles there that I would spend time on, and I keep being productive.

## Useful Mac Apps

My favorite albums are in iTunes, but now I mostly use the hipsterish Spotify. I try to journal every other day on Day One. I have a spaced-repetition-system in Anki, where I add flashcards with interesting stuff that I want to keep in my head. Contexts App for Mac gives me shortcuts for accessing apps only with my keyboard and BetterTouchTool + BetterSnapTool improve my keyboard/mouse actions. Bartender keeps my Mac notification area clean and iStatPro clutters it with more gauges.

## Time Tested Android Apps

Headspace keeps my mind calm every day. Sleep As Android is the ultimate waking up nightmare a heavy sleeper like me found working. Swiftkey makes typing on a small screen somewhat pleasent, especially since it supports 2 languages. Foursquare still knows to recommend me the best vegetarian places around. Maps felt like the best thing for navigation, however Citymapper is doing a better job in London to help me not get lost. Strava motivates me to treat casual running outside as a competition with other people. I might sometime play my Yamaha FG-300 guitar with a little guidance from Yousician.
