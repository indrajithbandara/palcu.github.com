A friend of mine was recently laid off by a software company in London. I've helped her land a new job in 21 days and I've learnt lots of useful things doing this.

She learnt about the decision one week before her contract ended. The first thing we did was to go over her resume and update it. I recommended her going through the resume checklist from The Breakout List website and paying close attention to each item.

Afterwards came updating the LinkedIn profile. Don't be ashamed of setting that you have ended work at a company. I think recruiters have a special filter for this because the number of messages became higher after she changed her job period.

Make a profile on Angelist, even though it feels like "Tinder for Companies". The instant gratification moment when somebody wants to talk to you after you've been fired will provide a big boost for the morale. Don't forget about StackOverflow Careers, though I don't believe it helps a lot when you are actively searching for a job.
