Each cell is either white or black. Your task is to detect whether all the black cells form a square shape. </blockquote>The statement of the problem is simple to understand. The obvious solution I came up with is:<br /><ol><li>iterate over the matrix and build a 0 or 1 new matrix for each white or black cells</li><li>count the number of black cells (I'll call it X)</li><li>if X is a perfect square then we may have a square matrix with the side length of sqrt(X)</li><ol></ol><ul><li>or else we cannot have a square shape inside the matrix </li></ul><ol></ol><li>iterate in the matrix and find the first row with black cells</li><li>get the first and the last positions of a black cell in that row</li><li>sum up the portions of the list in between the indices from the last step for every row</li><ul><li>until that sum is different from the expected side length</li><li>or the matrix ends</li></ul><ol></ol><li>check to see we have iterated the correct number of times</li><ol></ol></ol><br />Good example:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<br />0 0 <b>1 1 1 1</b> 0 0<br />0 0 <b>1 1 1 1</b> 0 0<br />0 0 <b>1 1 1 1 </b>0 0<br />0 0 <b>1 1 1 1 </b>0 0<br />0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</blockquote>We have 16 black cells, so we should have 4 consecutive row with 4 consecutive black cells. In step 4 and get indices 2 and 5. We then iterate for the next 4 rows and our algorithm stops returning a positive answer.<br /><br />Bad example:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<br />0 0 <b>1 1 1 1</b> 0 0<br />0 0 <b>1 1 1 1</b> 0 0<br />0 0 <b>1 1 1 1 </b>0 0<br />0 0 1 1 0 1<b> </b>0 0<br />0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0</blockquote>Same 16 black cells, but this time our algorithm will stop at step 7 after only 3 iterations.<br /><br />This is the solution I would have coded in C++ if I would not know Python.<br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="7665786" id="gist-7665786"><br />Loading gist ....</div><br />Now let's try to compress those lines with some beautiful Python syntax. Let's start first with the matrix conversion. We could use a <i>list comprehension</i> for each line of the matrix, and sum it with the builtin <i>sum</i> function.<br /><br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="7666014" id="gist-7666014">Loading gist ....</div><br />Remember that <i>m[-1]</i> means the last element of a list.<br /><br />Now, we could get the first line with a black cell by using the <i>filter</i> method and by leveraging the fact that an empty list can be viewed as <i>False</i> (Python is pretty logical).<br /><br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="7666149" id="gist-7666149">Loading gist ....</div><br />Those left and right indices could get some love. We could use <i>enumerate</i> to iterate over the list and get the index and the value in a list comprehension.<br /><br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="7666276" id="gist-7666276">Loading gist ....</div><br />Finally, here come slices, which I think it are the most concise and powerful feature in Python.   <i>v[left : right]</i> means you will get a list only with the elements in between the left and right indexes.<br /><br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="7666344" id="gist-7666344">Loading gist ....</div><br />We could move the line that asserts that our number of black cells is a perfect square to our last testing statement because we do not care about speed and we have two lines that print <i>NO</i>. Finally, our readable code after phytonification looks smooth.<br /><br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="7666501" id="gist-7666501">Loading gist ....</div><br />What remains last is to <i>minify</i> the code. I managed to reduce it to 12 lines and 412 chars.<br /><br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="7666521" id="gist-7666521">Loading gist ....</div><br />If this article convinced you to switch to Python you can start learning at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python">Codecademy</a> where they have a nice introduction track.  If you are a more visual person, Sebastian Thrun (the guy who is in charge of self-driving cars at Google) has an online course at <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101">Udacity</a>. Finally, if you are a 1337 hardcore geek, learn python <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">the hard way</a>.<br /><br />Edit: more Python elegance can be seen in the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-hacker-cup/2014-qualification-round-solutions/775180192497884">official solutions</a>. <br /><br />Edit 2: <a href="http://olariu.org/">Andrei Olariu</a> sent me a better version in 9 lines and 334 chars. I guess I'm still learning this sport :)<br /><br /><div class="gistLoad" data-id="7667885" id="gist-7667885">Loading gist ....</div><br /><i>I love reading, writing and spreading valuable stories.&nbsp;I share some of them on&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/AlexPalcuie">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://facebook.com/palcuiealex">Facebook</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com/+alexpalcuie">Google+</a>.&nbsp;</i><i>Read more&nbsp;<a href="http://palcu.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html">about me</a>.</i>
