Off goes this year's edition. I wrote more thoughts on [Gazeta de
Informatică][0]. There were 132 participants with 117 projects in the camp. You
can check out the [results][1]. We built from scratch a [new website][2] in
Rails and React this year. We had 17 [presentations][3] and workshops for the
students. I want to thank all the ther 4 core members in alphabetical order:
Alex Coman, Bogdan Gâza, Robert Dolca and Vlad Temian for doing an awesome job.
