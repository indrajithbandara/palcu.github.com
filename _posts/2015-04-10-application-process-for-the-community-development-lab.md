The Community and Development Lab is a traditional yearly ROSEdu project where we teach students how to start contributing to open source software. This year we had 117 applicants and had to select only 19 of them. To do this, we gave them an algorithms problem to filter 60 potential candidates which were invited to an interview.

To select the best students, we gave the students to solve an ACM style algorithms problem on the Infoarena judge. They had to code their solution in C, C++ or Java, submit it online and the judge would run it over 10 tests, checking the output and measuring the time and memory of their implementation. Most of the students who tried to solve this problem were in their 1st or 2nd undergraduate years at Computer Science or Computer Engineering in Bucharest.
