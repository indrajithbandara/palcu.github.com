> If you had to work out where to dig so that you didn’t cut off the water supply to an entire town, would you rely on a Ouija board for your answer? Probably not, but that is in effect what at least two UK water companies (now ten out of the twelve UK companies) openly admit to doing in 2017. Except instead of asking a Ouija board, they are asking divining (or dowsing) rods.

Have a new year full of [magic][0]!
