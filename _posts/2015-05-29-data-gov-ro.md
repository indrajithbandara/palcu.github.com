For the last 2 months I've been working for the Romanian government on the national open data portal [data.gov.ro](http://data.gov.ro/). I've been keeping a log of everything I've been doing there [here](http://gov.palcu.ro/), since I'm now being paid with public money. Also, all my work is [open source](https://github.com/govro/datagovro).
